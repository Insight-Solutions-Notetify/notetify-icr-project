        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          We are a team of 4 CSUF students whose original goal for this AI application was to help students easily translate their notes into text. We decided on this project because we know the trouble of transferring written text into online notes. However, with our project, we hope to help other students easily turn their written notes into text.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          However, as this project has gotten bigger, we are looking to expand the scope of use our AI has. Because our AI can transfer any written handwriting into text, it can be used in settings outside of school, such as offices, etc.
